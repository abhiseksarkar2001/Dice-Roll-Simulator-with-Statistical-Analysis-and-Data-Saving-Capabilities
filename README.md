# Dice-Roll-Simulator-with-Statistical-Analysis-and-Data-Saving-Capabilities

This program simulates the rolling of a dice and provides various statistical analysis and data saving capabilities. The user can input the number of sides on the dice, the number of rolls, and the number of dices they want to roll in each attempt. The program also provides a time delay option between rolls and the ability to save the results to a CSV file.

The program provides the following features:
* The histogram of the dice rolls
* The bar chart of the sum of the dice rolls in each attempt
* Mean, Median, and Standard deviation of the dice rolls
* The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the dice rolls
* The ability to save the results to a CSV file

## Requirements
* Python 3
* Matplotlib
* statistics
* csv

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/abhiseksarkar2001/Dice-Roll-Simulator-with-Statistical-Analysis-and-Data-Saving-Capabilities.git

2. Run the program
python dice_roll.py

3. Follow the prompts to input the number of sides on the dice, the number of rolls, and the number of dices you want to roll in each attempt.
4. Choose whether you want to add time delay between rolls or not.
5. Choose whether you want to save the results to a CSV file or not.

## Acknowledgments
The program uses libraries like matplotlib, statistics, and csv for statistical analysis and data
